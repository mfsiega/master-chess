# MasterChess

This is the frontend app for the MasterChess project.

MasterChess is a tool to study past master games. It is current in development.
To run the app, `npm run start`. It depends on a small backend which is
currently hardcoded to localhost.

It was generated with `create-react-app`, and most of the config is left default.
